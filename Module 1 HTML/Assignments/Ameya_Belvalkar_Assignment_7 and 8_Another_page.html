    <p><mark> Q7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs.
            You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into
            the same folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html
            page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html
            when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use
            the a and a tags in this exercise. Inside the tag a you need to use a
            href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link is clicked</mark></p>
            <p> <mark>Q8 .HTML tags like a can have certain attributes. The href attribute is 
                mandatory in the a tag. Additionally, it is possible to use the title attribute 
                which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a 
                link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the 
                previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when 
                the mouse cursor is over the link.

    <h1> AWS CLOUD SERVICES</h1>
    <p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and
        APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web
        services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms. One of these
        services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster
        of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the
        attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units
        (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and
        pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).</p>
    <p>AWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are
        based on a combination of usage (known as a "Pay-as-you-go" model), hardware, operating system, software, or
        networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, redundancy, security, and service options.
        Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either.[8]
        Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while
        other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability
        scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.[9]</p>
    <p>Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply
        than building an actual physical server farm.[10] All services are billed based on usage, but each service
        measures usage in varying ways. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next
        two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy
        Group.[11][12]</p>
