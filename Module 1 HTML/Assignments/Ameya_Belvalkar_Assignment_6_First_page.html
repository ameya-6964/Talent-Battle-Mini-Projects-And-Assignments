    <p> <mark> Q6. Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains
            a heading and two paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags h1, h1, p
            and /p in this exercise. As the texts in the heading and paragraphs you can
            use any texts you like.
            Add an unordered list to this web page.
            An unordered list can be specified with the tags ul and ul.
            An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be
            specified with tags li and /li.
            After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens
            when you convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags ul and ul with
            ol and ol, respectively.
            Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the
            img tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the
            Internet.

    <h1> What Is Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on
        those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and
        companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
    </p>
    <p>The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device, because the computing
        and storage takes place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on the user device. This is why a user
        can log in to their Instagram account on a new phone after their old phone breaks and still find their old
        account in place, with all their photos, videos, and conversation history. It works the same way with cloud
        email providers like Gmail or Microsoft Office 365, and with cloud storage providers like Dropbox or Google
        Drive.</p>
    <p>For businesses, switching to cloud computing removes some IT costs and overhead: for instance, they no longer
        need to update and maintain their own servers, as the cloud vendor they are using will do that. This especially
        makes an impact for small businesses that may not have been able to afford their own internal infrastructure but
        can outsource their infrastructure needs affordably via the cloud. The cloud can also make it easier for
        companies to operate internationally, because employees and customers can access the same files and applications
        from any location.</p>
