      History

      Ajanta - Ellora Caves are one of the most visited ancient monuments in
      India, and among the major heritage places to visit near Aurangabad. The
      Caves were carved between the 2nd Century BC and 6th Century AD.
      Construction of the caves was carried out in two phases; the first group
      of caves was built around the 2nd century BC, while the second group was
      built between the 4th & 6th centuries.<br />

      Ajanta Caves are excavated in the horseshoe-shaped bend of rock surface
      nearly 76 m in height overlooking the Waghur River. Built using only
      hammer and chisel, these caves served as secluded retreats for Buddhist
      monks for about nine centuries, then abruptly abandoned. These caves were
      rediscovered by an Army Officer in the Madras Regiment of the British Army
      in 1819 during one of his hunting expeditions. Instantly the discovery
      became very famous and Ajanta became an important tourist destination in
      India.<br />
      The complex consists of 29 rock-cut cave monuments built in two distinct
      periods, out of which one part of the complex was developed during the
      Satavahana period and the other was done during the Vakataka period. Caves
      9, 10, 12, 13, and 15A were built in the first phase during the Satavahana
      dynasty and they belong to the Hinayana phase of Buddhism. Of these Cave 9
      & 10 are chaityagrihas and Cave 12, 13, & 15A are viharas. These caves are
      datable to the pre-Christian era, the earliest among them being Cave 10
      dating from the 2nd century BC. The second period of construction was
      carried out during the rule of Emperor Harisena of the Vakataka dynasty.
      Close to 20 cave temples were simultaneously built which resemble the
      modern-day monasteries with a sanctum at the rear end of the structure.
      Though all the caves are interesting to watch, Cave 1, 2, 16, 17, 19, and
      26 are must-see attractions in Ajanta.<br />
      The caves at Ajanta are famous for beautiful mural paintings and
      sculptures that depict tales of Jatakas. The world-famous paintings at
      Ajanta also fall into two broad phases. The earliest is noticed in the
      form of fragmentary specimens in Cave 9 & 10, which are among the must-see
      places as part of Ajanta tour packages. The headgear and other ornaments
      of the images in these paintings resemble the bas-relief sculpture of
      Sanchi and Bharhut.<br />
      The second phase of paintings started around the 5th - 6th centuries and
      continued for the next two centuries. The specimen of these exemplary
      paintings of the Vakataka period could be noticed in Cave 1, 2, 16, and
      17.<br />
      The artwork in the caves comprises well-preserved wall paintings of
      Bodhisattva, Padmapani, and Avalokiteshvara. Various incidents from the
      life of Gautama Buddha and the Jataka Tales are represented and recreated
      on the walls of these caves. Scenes from the royal court of the respective
      eras are also painted.
