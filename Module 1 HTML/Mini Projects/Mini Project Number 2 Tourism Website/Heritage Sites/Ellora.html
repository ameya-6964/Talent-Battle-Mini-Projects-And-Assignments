      History
    </h2>
    <p
      style="font-size: 130%; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif"
    >
      The Ellora Caves were built at a time when Buddhism was declining in India
      and Hinduism was beginning to reassert itself. The Brahmanical movement
      was especially powerful under the patronage of the Chalukyas and
      Rashtrakutas, who oversaw most of the work at Ellora - including the
      magnificent Kailash Temple built in the 8th century. The last period of
      building activity took place in the 10th century when the local rulers
      switched allegiance from Shaivism to the Digambara sect of Jainism.
      <br /><br />Ellora Caves are an impressive complex of Buddhist, Hindu, and
      Jain cave temples. The caves have a slightly less dramatic setting than
      those at Ajanta, but more exquisite sculptures. The cave complex comprises
      34 caves that were hewn out of solid rocks of the Charanandri hills. Of
      these, 12 caves belong to the Buddhist sect, 17 were Hindu and 5 were Jain
      Caves. Caves 1 to 12 are Buddhist monasteries, chaityas, and viharas,
      while caves 13 to 29 are the Hindu temples. Dating back to the 9th and
      10th century, Caves 30 to 34 are the Jain shrines. The coexistence of
      structures from three different religions serves as a splendid visual
      representation of the prevalent religious tolerance of India. Ellora caves
      can be visited along with Aurangabad holiday packages.
