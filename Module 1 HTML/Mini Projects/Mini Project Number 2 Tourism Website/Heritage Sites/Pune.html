      Situated at an altitude of 560 m, Pune is among popular Tourist places in

      Ajanta Caves are excavated in the horseshoe-shaped bend of rock surface
      nearly 76 m in height overlooking the Waghur River. Built using only
      hammer and chisel, these caves served as secluded retreats for Buddhist
      monks for about nine centuries, then abruptly abandoned. These caves were
      rediscovered by an Army Officer in the Madras Regiment of the British Army
      in 1819 during one of his hunting expeditions. Instantly the discovery
      became very famous and Ajanta became an important tourist destination in
      India.<br /><br />

      Pune was earlier known as Punya-Nagari or Queen of Deccan. Earlier, Pune
      was ruled by the Rashtrakutas and it was a part of the Yadava Empire of
      Devgiri from the 9th century to 1327 AD. It was once the center of power
      of the Maratha Empire established by Shivaji Maharaj. During his reign,
      the place witnessed significant development and growth in every aspect. In
      1730 AD, Pune became the political center of the Peshwas, who were the
      prime ministers of the Maratha Empire. The town witnessed an invasion by
      British India in 1817 AD. It was served as the monsoon capital and the
      cantonment town to the British until India got independence in 1947.<br />

      Pune is considered the cultural capital of Maharashtra and is renowned for
      its cultural activities such as classical music, spirituality, theater,
