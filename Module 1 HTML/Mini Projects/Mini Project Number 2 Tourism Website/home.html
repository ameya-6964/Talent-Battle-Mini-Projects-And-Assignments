<h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Welcome To Maharashtra Tourism</h2>
<p style="font-size: 130%;">
  Located in the heart of India, with a command of the Arabian Sea through its port of Mumbai, Maharashtra has a remarkable physical homogeneity, enforced by its underlying geology. The dominant physical trait of the state is its plateau character; Maharashtra's western part of coastal plains, western upturned rims rising to form the Sahyadri Range, and its slopes gently descending towards the east and southeast. The major rivers and their master tributaries have carved the plateau into alternating broad-river valleys and intervening higher lever interfluves, such as the Ahmednagar, Buldhana, and Yavatmal plateau.
  The Sahyadri Range is the physical backbone of Maharashtra. Rising on an average to an elevation of 100om. it falls in cliffs, to the Konkan on the west. Eastwards, the hill country falls in steps through a transitional area known as Maval to the plateau level. The series of crowning plateaux on the crest forms a distinctive feature of the Sahyadri Range.
  The Konkan, lying between the Arabian Sea and the Sahyadri Range is a narrow coastal lowland, barely 50 km wide. Though
  mostly below 200 m., it is far from being a plain country. Highly dissected and broken, the Konkan alternates between narrow,
  steep-sided valleys and low laterite plateaux.
  The Satpuras, hills along the northern border, and the Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri Ranges on the eastern border form physical barriers preventing easy movement, but also serve as natural limits to the state and have severe many earthquakes in district Latur.

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">History Of Maharashtra</h2>
<p style="font-size: 130%;">
  The first man arrived in Maharashtra millions of years back, gradually developing his skills in agriculture and metal smelting.
  The coastline provided the port that brought prosperity to the land during the historic period. The region was ruled by various dynasties like Satavahanas, Vakatakas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, and many more. Deccan Sultanates shaped the culture of
  Maharashtra in unique ways.
  The identity of Maharashtra was carved by the mighty Maratha empire. Chhatrapati ShivajiMaharaj laid down the foundation of the Maratha empire with the help of hill forts in Maharashtra, gradually evolved into the mighty empire extending up to
  Atak on the banks of river Indus in Pakistan.
  The British Era introduced new technology which helped Maharashtra to carve a niche in the Modern World.
